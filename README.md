-  Iâ€™m currently working on getting my assoiates in cybersecurity and transfering to CSUSB. I am 1 year out of highschool so I do not have much knowledge in college. I am currently learning how to code and this is my first programming class so it will likely be fairly hard for me to learn.

-  I like working on cars and unfortunately mine broke down just yesterday on my way home.
-  I have an annoying little cat that I love with all my heart who is currently 5 months old.
-  I am a complete neard when it comes to certain things such as anime, manga, manhwa, etc.
-  One final thing about me is that I really enjoy working out and I also love the cold
